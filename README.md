========

In this project I will try to build system to create map of categories from theorems.

Core elements:
- 'Crowler' will parse different sources like internet, books, scientific articles and thesis documents.
- 'Semantic analyzer' will analyze founded formulas, and parse it in some format (not developed yet).
- 'Category Graph' storage of parsed theorems in terms of category theory and homology.
- 'Processor' will analyze, predict and proof morphisms.

Technologies: 
- Haskell, Python and R as basic technologies.
- Agda
